SupportPilot — Customer Handling Master Framework

This covers:

 Conversation lifecycle (opening → closing)
 State machine
 Intent detection
Order verification flow
 Anger & bad-behavior handling
 No-response logic
 Escalation rules
 Polite but firm responses


## 1️⃣ Conversation Lifecycle (High Level)

Every conversation must move through **clear stages**:

1. **Open**
2. **Understand**
3. **Verify**
4. **Resolve / Guide**
5. **Escalate (if needed)**
6. **Close**
7. **Timeout / No Response**

---

## 2️⃣ Conversation State Machine (Core)

Use these **explicit states** in your system:

```text
START
→ GREETING
→ INTENT_DETECTION
→ INFO_REQUIRED
→ VERIFICATION_PENDING
→ VERIFIED
→ ACTION_IN_PROGRESS
→ WAITING_CUSTOMER
→ ESCALATION
→ RESOLVED
→ CLOSED
→ NO_RESPONSE_CLOSED
```

### State transition rules

 Never resolve before verification
 Never escalate without clear reason
Never close without confirmation or timeout


 Opening & Greeting (Always Polite)
 Rules

Warm
Neutral
Professional
No assumptions
Example

 Hi 👋 Thanks for contacting SupportPilot.
I’m here to help. Could you please tell me what you need assistance with today?

Intent Detection (Critical)

Detect what the user wants before replying.

Common intents

| Intent         | Examples                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Refund         | “I need my refund”, “Money back” |
| Order status   | “Where is my order?”             |
| Delivery delay | “Order not delivered”            |
| Complaint      | “Worst service”                  |
| Urgent demand  | “I want it today”                |
| Abuse          | “You people are useless”         |
| Silent         | No reply                         |

Intent detection signals

Keywords (`refund`, `cancel`, `angry words`)
Repetition
All caps
Short commands (“REFUND NOW”)

Order Verification Flow (Mandatory)
Never act without verification

Ask minimum required info

Order ID (primary)
Phone/email (backup)

Polite verification request
 I’ll be happy to help with your refund.
To check this for you, could you please share your **order ID**?

If user refuses

Stay calm
Repeat necessity
Don’t argue

I understand this is urgent.
For security reasons, I need the **order ID** to proceed. Once I have it, I’ll immediately check the status for you.

Handling Urgency & Demands (Your Example)
Scenario:

User: I need my refund today.

First response (calm + procedural)

> I understand you’d like your refund processed as soon as possible.
Let me check this for you — could you please share your order ID?

User repeats demand aggressively:

I SAID I NEED MY REFUND TODAY

System detects:

High urgency
Repetition
Emotional escalation
Correct response (polite + firm + empathetic)
I understand how frustrating this must feel, and I truly want to help you.
 However, I can’t access or process a refund without verifying your order.
Please share your **order ID**, and I’ll take this forward immediately.

---

 Anger & Emotion Handling

Anger detection signals

Caps lock
Threats
Now”, “Immediately”
Insults

Response rules
Never match tone
Never argue
Acknowledge emotion
Redirect to solution

Example

I hear your concern and I’m sorry for the inconvenience caused.
Let’s get this resolved — once I have your order details, I’ll check all possible options for you.

Bad Behavior / Abuse Handling

If language becomes abusive

Use 3-step approach:

Step 1: Calm warning

> I’m here to help, but I won’t be able to continue if abusive language is used. Let’s work together to resolve this.

Step 2: Firm boundary

I want to assist you, but I need us to keep the conversation respectful.

Step 3: Escalation or termination

I’m escalating this to a senior support specialist who will review your case.

---

Escalation Rules (When & How)

Escalate when:

User is angry & uncooperative
Refund policy exception needed
Repeated demands without info
Threats or legal language

Escalation response

I understand this needs urgent attention.
 I’m escalating your request to our senior support team for further review. They’ll assist you as soon as possible.

 Action State (After Verification)

Once order ID is received:

Example

Thank you for sharing the order ID.
I’m checking the refund status now — please allow me a moment.

Then:

 Approved → explain timeline
 Pending → explain reason
 Rejected → explain policy

---

Closing Logic
Successful resolution

Your refund has been processed successfully.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?

User confirms no more help
Thank you for contacting SupportPilot. Have a great day! 😊


No Response / Timeout Logic

Suggested timers

* First reminder: 1 minutes
* Second reminder: 1 hours
* Auto-close: 1 hours

Reminder message
Just checking in — I’m still here if you’d like help with this.

Final close
Since we haven’t heard back, I’ll close this conversation for now. You can reach out anytime if you need further assistance.
