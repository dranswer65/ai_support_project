🔜 Next steps (as you requested — one by one)

We’ll proceed in the exact order you defined, no shortcuts:

STEP 1️⃣ — Convert this into AI-ready knowledge chunks (JSON / RAG)

Next I will:

Break this document into atomic chunks

Add:

intent

category

customer_type

allowed_actions

escalation_required

Output production-grade JSON ready for:

Pinecone / Qdrant / FAISS

LangChain / LlamaIndex

Your FastAPI backend

👉 This will be copy-paste deployable.

STEP 2️⃣ — System + Developer prompt (SupportPilot Agent)

Persona: Professional furniture support executive

Hard rules (refunds, SLAs, no policy violation)

Safe response patterns

WhatsApp-friendly tone

STEP 3️⃣ — Real customer chat simulations

Angry customer

Refund delay

Cash vs card confusion

Return rejected (packaging missing)

Escalation case

These chats will prove your AI quality to clients.

STEP 4️⃣ — AI → Human escalation workflow

Confidence-based escalation

SLA breach triggers

WhatsApp → agent handover

Audit logging (important for SaaS sales)

STEP 5️⃣ — Map to your FastAPI + WhatsApp system

Intent → chunk → response flow

Sample /chat payload

Confidence scoring

Human handoff flag

👉 Your move

Confirm this with one word so I proceed cleanly:

“Proceed Step 1”

Once you say that, I’ll generate the AI-ready JSON chunks immediately 🚀
