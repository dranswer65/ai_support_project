Can I place an order for a product that's out of stock?
We regularly update our product range with new items, but every once in a while you may miss out on something. Enter your email address in the Notify Me box next to the product, and you'll be the first to know when it's back in stock.

What factors should I consider before placing an order for a large item?
Before ordering any large item, please check the dimensions of the lift, main door and other entry points in your premises.

Will I be charged for delivery?
If you’re opting for Scheduled delivery or 2-day Express delivery for select furniture, your shipping charges will vary based on your location. Refer to our Shipping page to know more.

For all other household products, delivery is free on orders of AED 500 and above. If your total order value is less than AED 500, you will be charged AED 18 for delivery.

I was disconnected from the internet while my order was being processed. How do I complete my order?
That sounds terrible. Fortunately, if a Thank You screen hasn't been displayed, it means your order hasn't been processed. Restart the process and try again.
